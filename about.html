                    <h2>My Background</h2>
                    <p>Hello and welcome to my own personal portfolio website. My name is Lauren Tharpe, a student who is currently studying at the University of Winnipeg.
                    My dream is not only to dive into the computer science field as a whole, but to create meaningful computer science related content for the world to enjoy whether
                    it be a personal passion project or a company-run change in the technology we use today.<span id = "dots1">..</span><span id="invisible-text1"> Currently, I am working towards a bachelors
                    degree in Applied Computer Science. Thus far I have gained experience in Python, Java, HTML, CSS, and Blender. I'd like to say I'm quick to pick up new topics as a lot of 
                    my skills, including the ones I used to build this website, are self-taught. I've worked on projects that range in all sorts of required skills, like a discord chatbot taught with an AI,
                    multiple Java and Python based games, as well as a few webscrapers.</span></p><br>

                    <h2>More About Me </h2>
                    If you want to get to know me on a more personal level, this section is for you. On my downtime I enjoy playing video games, watching TV, reading, going out with friends, and bettering my computer science
                    skills, of course. My favorite show right now is Stranger things, my favorite video game is Dead By Daylight, and my personal favorite out of the projects I've done is my discord chatbot.
                    <span id = "dots2">..</span><span id="invisible-text2"> On a typical Friday night you'll either find me in my room talking to friends over Discord or going to a gaming cafe with friends! I am 
                    the type of person who isn't afraid to tell you my opinion and analysis on a situation. There's nothing that can stop me once I gain a passion for a certain project or 
                    subject and will work nonstop to finish it out of pure excitement. I'm very achievement-oriented and love to use my imagination to either design a front-end element or 
                    conjure a solution to a backend problem.</span> <br>
